# python_learning

This is a personal repository which i use to study and learn python
Here I will upload small projects that I am creating to advance in programming with python.
Any type of contributions, help, advice, tips and teaching methods are welcome. I do this to advance my path in programming and try to make a life as a programmer.
Below I will leave a guide on how I will organize the repository and the structure of the projects (comments, folders, files), this can change at any time and I may forget to update the readme hahahaha.

## **structure**

 The structure of the folders will be divided according to the projects, at this    moment they will all be beginner projects, but if I manage to get to advanced I  will make their respective folder in the future.
Following the next order:
* **<\*project level\*>** (beginner, advanced, expert(I hope one day i can get here T-T))
* **<\*language\*>** (Python, JavaS, Bash, etc...)
* **<\*category\*>** (If possible, I will specify a category like network, automatization, cybersecurity, etc... Otherwise they will belong to the "others" category.)
* **<\*project name\*>** (Name of the project, I think this did not have to be specified but just in case -_-").
Example Beginner/python/network/MAC_changer/<*files of the repository*>
